## Basic Line Movements:
1. Move to the start of the line: `ctrl` + `a`
2. Move to the end of the line: `ctrl` + `e`
3. Cut from the cursor to the end of the line: `ctrl` + `k`
4. Delete the entire line: `ctrl` + `a` and `ctrl` + `k`
5. Move forward a word: `option(alt)` + `f` (a word contains alphabets and digits, no symbols)
6. Move backward a word: `option(alt)` + `b` 
                          or `option` + `left`
