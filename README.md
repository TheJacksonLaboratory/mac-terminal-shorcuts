## Basic Line Movements:
1. Move to the start of the line: `CTRL` + `a`
2. Move to the end of the line: `CTRL` + `e`
5. Move forward a word (a word contains alphabets and digits, no symbols): `OPTION(META)` + `f` or  `OPTION` + `right`
6. Move backward a word: `OPTION(META)` + `b` or `OPTION` + `left`

## Deleting words and characters
1. Delete words from the cursor to the end of the line: `CTRL` + `k`
2. Delete words backwards (like backspace for characters): `CTRL` + `w` or `OPTION` + `backspace (delete key)`

## Super shortcuts
1. Delete the entire line: `CTRL` + `a` and `CTRL` + `k`
